# Ant optimization with Spiking Neural Networks and NetLogo
Per default the optimizee uses the NEST simulator as a back-end.
To change the back-end to NetLogo replace in the `config_ant.json` file the model value from `"model_name": "ant_colony_netlogo_nest_l2l.nlogo"` to `"model_name": "ant_colony_spikinglab_l2l.nlogo"`.
